# PRINCIPLES-OF-PROGRAMMING-LANGUAGES
PRINCIPLES OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES Project - HCMUT

**HIGHLIGHT: PRINCIPLES OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES is one of the Core Course when Study Computer Scienece in HCMUT. **

## Principles of Programming Languages:
**Dives into the core concepts that underpin all programming languages. It goes beyond learning the syntax and semantics of a specific language, and instead, focuses on the fundamental building blocks that allow programmers to express computations and create software.**

This course explores topics like:

* Data types and variables: Understanding different types of data (numbers, text, etc.) and how variables store and manipulate them.
* Expressions and control flow: Building logical expressions and using control flow structures like loops and conditionals to control program execution.
* Subprograms and functions: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, reusable functions or subprograms.
* Abstraction: Creating abstractions like data structures and classes to represent real-world concepts in a simplified way.
* Paradigms: Exploring different programming paradigms like imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming, each with its own strengths and use cases.
* Evaluation and interpretation: Understanding how programs are translated and executed by the computer.

By mastering these principles, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how programming languages work and become more proficient in any language you choose to learn in the future.


## Project Work
**REQUIREMENTS: ** Build a programming language named Z_Code. 
> [!NOTE]
> Z_Code description can be found in zcode-specification.pdf
> There are 4 parts for this Project, each part is a state when building the language
> Each part description can be found in each part's folder
